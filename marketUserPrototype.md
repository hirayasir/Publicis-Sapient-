Understand Your Users

the user research

The user research indicates that the website is effective if the user already has an idea of where they want to travel, but it's not ideal for getting ideas on where to go for a vacation based on the user's interests. Users also find it cumbersome to have to click onto a new page to preview each destination rather than preview multiple destinations at once. Additionally, users found the map overwhelming because it showed too many listings at once and cumbersome because you could only filter the map by location and not by category such as beach destinations.
